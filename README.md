# Modelling-Spread-of-Covid
A collection of different models to analyze the spread of Covid. I used them in the context of Singapore.

What you can use this for:
Graph plotting for infection rates, susceptibility and more.

How you can use it:
Update the parameters based on your research/data collected. (I used data from Singapore, in which I stored in a CSV file)
Tweak the model to add/remove parts of the model that you need.

Models included:
DDE (Delayed Differential Equation Model)
SEIQR
SEIR
SIR
Random Walks (Attempt)
